## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** and this site is great because it helps us improve our **coding skills** with real projects and more varied difficulties. The site gives us the possibility to train any skill or web technology that we want, be it media-querie, grid layout, Jquery, React, etc..

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **Calculator App** as close as possible to the original design.

In this challenge I used my studies in React Js, Typescript and Styled-components to create this calculator, it can be used to do complex or simple calculations and you can also change the theme with a simple button if you get tired of the other colors. Soon I will update it and bring new functionality
